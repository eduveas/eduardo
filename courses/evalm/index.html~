      <div id="lecture-description">

<p>This specialized course concentrates on evaluation methodologies for research and innovation. The course applies a user centric design (UCD) methodology. At each stage, appropriate methodologies will be introduced with a human perspective. The course will address conventional interfaces (e.g., visualization) and also frontier, less conventional methods (e.g., Augmented Reality, 3D User Interfaces)</p>
<p>The student taking this course will learn through experience to:</p>
<ul>
<li>incorporate evaluation methodologies in the research process</li>
<li>understand which methodology is appropriate for a particular interface and research question</li>
<li>understand how to use advanced technology (eye-tracking, BCI) for evaluation purposes</li>
<li>understand and critique scientific text involving evaluation methodologies</li>
</ul>

<p>More importantly, from experience, the student will learn how formulate research questions and hypotheses, how build evaluations to test those hypotheses, how to record and collect evidence, analyze it, derive knowledge from it, and report findings from evaluations.</p>

	<h3> Readings </h3>
	<div id="lecture-lit-contents"><p>Continuous evaluation serves as a research methodology in many fields of Computer Science. This lecture is intended to familiarize you with a range of methods applied when continuous evaluation is used in research, desing and innovation. The following is a list of the main textbooks that will be referenced throughout the lecture. You can borrow them from the university library, or come to Eduardo's office to browse them (make an appointment).

	    <h4> User Centric Design and Human Factors</h4>

	    <p>
	    <span class="book-title">Foundations for Designing User Centred Systems. Ritter, Baxter, Churchill, </span> is a thorough reference for the UCD methodology. It dedicates a good portion of the book to understanding people, human factors, behavior and cognition. The chapter on evaluation provides a good, general entry point to the different aspects of evaluations. In the lecture, this book serves as reference for UCD but also for considerations about the user capabilities.<a href="http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4471-5134-0"> Link</a>
	    </p>

	  </div>

	  <div>
	    <h4>Formal Evaluation: Statistics for Analysis</h4>
	    <p>
	    <span class="book-title">Discovering Statistics Using R (Andy Field, Jeremy Miles, Zoe Field)</span> is our main reference to the implementation of statistics methods used for analyses of evaluation results. It is a thorough reference with example implementations in R, covering the major aspects of research and analysis of evaluation results introduced in this lecture. It is a recommended read, which will be heavily used in weeks 3-6, and will surely accompany the students beyond the lecture in their carreer.

	<h3>What this course is NOT</div>
      <div id="is-not-content">
      <p>This course is not an introduction to HCI nor to visualization. For general courses on the topics covered visit:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>HCI (Keith Andrews)</li>
	<li>Visual Analytics (Marc Streit)</li>
	<li>AKCG (Denis Kalkofen)</li>
	<li>Augmented Reality (Dieter Schmalstieg)</li>
      </ul>

	<p>This course will not deal with web usability, as that topic is extensively covered by Keith Andrews course on <a href="http://courses.iicm.tugraz.at/iaweb/">Information Architecture and Web Usability</a>. Instead the course concentrates on providing a solid background on the different evaluation methods as applied in a UCD continuous evaluation process. This course is no replacement for an advanced statistics lecture. Descriptive and inferential statistics methods will be used  to guide the preparation of data, the performance of appropriate statistical tests, their interpretation and reporting of results. <p>

	<h3>Who should attend this course</div>
      <div id="who-should-content">
	This course is particularly suited for students (Msc.) and researchers (PhD.) investigating or developing novel metaphors to interact with computers and machines. It is also suited for researchers trying to understand the user behaviour and how it is influenced by technology. This includes psychology majors as well as educators. Students in the final year of their Bak. may benefit from this course too.
