      <div id="lecture-description">

	<p>This specialized course concentrates on evaluation methodologies for research and innovation. The course applies a user centric design (UCD) methodology. At each stage, appropriate methodologies will be introduced with a human perspective. The course will address conventional interfaces (e.g., visualization) and also frontier, less conventional methods (e.g., Augmented Reality, 3D User Interfaces)</p>

	<p>The student taking this course will learn through experience to:</p>

<ul>
<li>incorporate evaluation methodologies in the research process</li>
<li>understand which methodology is appropriate for a particular interface and research question</li>
<li>understand how to use advanced technology (eye-tracking, BCI) for evaluation purposes</li>
<li>understand and critique scientific text involving evaluation methodologies</li>
</ul>

<p>More importantly, from experience, the student will learn how formulate research questions and hypotheses, how build evaluations to test those hypotheses, how to record and collect evidence, analyze it, derive knowledge from it, and report findings from evaluations.</p>

	      <h4 class="title-abstract">Abstract:</h4>

 With the popularization of 3D user interfaces driven forward by in particular 3D consoles like the Wii or Kinect, unconventional interfaces have found entrance in the daily life of many a user. Yet designing and, in particular, validating these kinds of interfaces is not straightforward. Within this talk, a design approach will be introduced that can be applied when designing and validating unconventional interfaces. The design approach, called human potential driven design, deploys the full potential of the human body to perceive sensory information and control an application. It follows a strongly human-factors driven methodology that pinpoints well specific issues that need to be carefully considered through the iterative stages of analysis, conceptualization, design and validation of an interface. Doing so, common pitfalls and lessons learned will be intertwined while illustrating the approach through a range of unconventional interfaces from different domains, including mobile technology, augmented and virtual reality. Next to visual interfaces, a particular focus will be put on stimulating all senses, by looking closely at tactile, haptic and multisensory interfaces.

	<h3> Projects </h3>
	<div id="projects-content">
	  <h4>Recommendations while reading: </h4>
	  <p>
	  A recommender system delivers a list of articles and media related to a text, such as a wikipedia page. There is a minimal format for each recommendation item, which can be extended by the authors. The intention of this project is to attract attention to recommended items. It would be useful to see what part of the text recommended items are related to.</p>
	  <h4>Recommendations while writing</h4>
	  <p>a recommender system delivers a list of scientific articles related to a piece of text, a keyword or keyphrase. The intention of this project is to introduce recommendations during writing (content creatiion). What kind of interfaces would be appropriate?.</p>

	  <h4>Augmented recommendations</h4>this project investigates interfaces to deliver recommendations to personal devices. The goal is to show recommendations related to a physical object (e.g., written text on a sheet of paper) that is captured with the personal device. Any sort of personal device is allowed (smartphone, glasses, handheld projector). Comparison of interfaces for different technologies are encouraged.

	  <h4>Visual augmentation with instructions</h4><p> this project is intended to propose and evaluate methods to show instructions augmented onto real world objects. For example, we would like to guide a person in the preparation of a Cafe Moka, from disassembly of the Coffee pot to brewing the coffee.
	    </p>
	  <h4 style="text-decoration:line-through;" >BCI control of appliance: </h4>
	  <p style="text-decoration:line-through;">
	    this project is intended to evaluate methods to control a simple appliance using a EEG (BCI) or another bio-signal. The project should explore how to select the appliance and how to choose control modes and execute them.

	<h3> Readings </h3>
	<div id="lecture-lit-contents"><p>Continuous evaluation serves as a research methodology in many fields of Computer Science. This lecture is intended to familiarize you with a range of methods applied when continuous evaluation is used in research, desing and innovation. The following is a list of the main textbooks that will be referenced throughout the lecture. You can borrow them from the university library, or come to Eduardo's office to browse them (make an appointment).

	    <h4> User Centric Design and Human Factors</h4>

	    <p>
	    <span class="book-title">Foundations for Designing User Centred Systems. Ritter, Baxter, Churchill, </span> is a thorough reference for the UCD methodology. It dedicates a good portion of the book to understanding people, human factors, behavior and cognition. The chapter on evaluation provides a good, general entry point to the different aspects of evaluations. In the lecture, this book serves as reference for UCD but also for considerations about the user capabilities.<a href="http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4471-5134-0"> Link</a>

	  <div>
	    <h4>Formal Evaluation: Statistics for Analysis</h4>
	    <p>
	    <span class="book-title">Discovering Statistics Using R (Andy Field, Jeremy Miles, Zoe Field)</span> is our main reference to the implementation of statistics methods used for analyses of evaluation results. It is a thorough reference with example implementations in R, covering the major aspects of research and analysis of evaluation results introduced in this lecture. It is a recommended read, which will be heavily used in weeks 3-6, and will surely accompany the students beyond the lecture in their carreer.

	<h3>What this course is NOT</div>
      <div id="is-not-content">
      <p>This course is not an introduction to HCI nor to visualization. For general courses on the topics covered visit:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>InfoVis (Keith Andrews)</li>
	<li>HCI (Keith Andrews)</li>
	<li>Visual Analytics (Marc Streit)</li>
	<li>AKCG (Denis Kalkofen)</li>
	<li>Augmented Reality (Dieter Schmalstieg)</li>
      </ul>

	<p>This course will not deal with web usability, as that topic is extensively covered by Keith Andrews course on <a href="http://courses.iicm.tugraz.at/iaweb/">Information Architecture and Web Usability</a>. Instead the course concentrates on providing a solid background on the different evaluation methods as applied in a UCD continuous evaluation process. This course is no replacement for an advanced statistics lecture. Descriptive and inferential statistics methods will be used  to guide the preparation of data, the performance of appropriate statistical tests, their interpretation and reporting of results. <p>

	<h3>Who should attend this course</div>
      <div id="who-should-content">
	This course is particularly suited for post-graduate students (Msc.) and researchers (PhD.) investigating or developing novel metaphors to interact with computers and machines. It is also suited for researchers trying to understand the user behaviour and how it is influenced by technology. This includes psychology majors as well as educators. Students in the final year of their Bak. may benefit from this course too.
