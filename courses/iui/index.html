	<p>
	
	  This course is about interfaces that collect data from the user and create models to anticipate or adapt the interaction accordingly. The course offers an opportunity to dive into machine learning topics applied to user interfaces. In doing so, the course introduces important concepts inherent to intelligent systems that interact with humans:  interactive machine learning, interfaces to machine learning and active learning systems. Students tackle the issue of building an interface using algorithms that beyond learning to solve a task, use machine intelligence to learn about the human and the human behaviour. Gradual introduction to the topics of human-aware interaction.
	</p>


<p>The student taking this course will learn through experience to:</p>
<ul>
<li>understand how too collect data with a user interface</li>
<li>understand how to apply machine learning algorithms to interfaces</li>
<li>have an insight about how modern computing systems collect and use data from humans</li
</ul>

<p>More importantly, from experience, the student will learn to formulate data collection strategies to jumpstart an intelligent interface and to apply machine learning to continuously improve the interaction.</p>

	<h3> Grading </h3>

	<p>
      20% participation
      20% critique
      60% project topic
      </p>
	<p>
	  The course is project based. Projects should be carried out in groups of up-to 3 people.
	  Projects will require the existence of an App with a user interface, or some method to collect data from human participants and deliver feedback. Students are encouraged to reuse applications or devices built in other classes: User Interfaces, Visual Analytics, Game Design, etc. A collection of alternative projects are available within the Intelligent User Interfaces Lab of Prof. Veas.
	  For the course, the student will:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>choose a project topic to build an intelligent interface</li>
	  <li>propose a data collection strategy</li>
	  <li>desing the algorithm based intelligence</li>
	  <li>build and showcase a demo of the system</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>What this course is NOT</div>
      <div id="is-not-content">
      <p>This course is not an introduction to HCI nor to visualization. It will not offer the possibility to design a user interface, an application, nor a visualization. For general courses on the topics covered visit:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>User Interfaces (Eduardo Veas)</li>
	<li>Evaluation Methods (Eduardo Veas)</li>
	<li>HCI (Keith Andrews)</li>
	<li>Visual Analytics (Sabol, Schreck, Veas)</li>
	<li>Augmented Reality (Dieter Schmalstieg)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This course will not deal with building a user interface or application from scratch. Students are advised to use prototypes built in previous courses. Neither will this course provide detailed information on experimental designs for data collection. Instead the course concentrates on providing a solid background on methods and techniques behind intelligent user interfaces including data collection strategy, algorithm, feedback (adaption or direct interaction with human).
	This course is no replacement for a machine learning course. <p>
